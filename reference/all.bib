abstract="Exchanging model updates is a widely used method in the modern federated learning system. For a long time, people believed that gradients are safe to share: i.e., the gradients are less informative than the training data. However, there is information hidden in the gradients. Moreover, it is even possible to reconstruct the private training data from the publicly shared gradients. This chapter discusses techniques that reveal information hidden in gradients and validate the effectiveness on common deep learning tasks. It is important to raise people's awareness to rethink the gradient's safety. Several possible defense strategies have also been discussed to prevent such privacy leakage.",

abstract="We propose a novel unsupervised learning approach to build features suitable for object detection and classification. The features are pre-trained on a large dataset without human annotation and later transferred via fine-tuning on a different, smaller and labeled dataset. The pre-training consists of solving jigsaw puzzles of natural images. To facilitate the transfer of features to other tasks, we introduce the context-free network (CFN), a siamese-ennead convolutional neural network. The features correspond to the columns of the CFN and they process image tiles independently (i.e., free of context). The later layers of the CFN then use the features to identify their geometric arrangement. Our experimental evaluations show that the learned features capture semantically relevant content. We pre-train the CFN on the training set of the ILSVRC2012 dataset and transfer the features on the combined training and validation set of Pascal VOC 2007 for object detection (via fast RCNN) and classification. These features outperform all current unsupervised features with {\$}{\$}51.8{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}for detection and {\$}{\$}68.6{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}for classification, and reduce the gap with supervised learning ({\$}{\$}56.5{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}and {\$}{\$}78.2{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}respectively).",

@inproceedings{li2018federated,
 abstract = {Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm with two key challenges that differentiate it from traditional distributed optimization: (1) significant variability in terms of the systems characteristics on each device in the network (systems heterogeneity), and (2) non-identically distributed data across the network (statistical heterogeneity). In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg\textemdash improving absolute test accuracy by 18.8\% on average.},
